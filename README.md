# Loan Amount Approval Service
This is an example of a loan amount approval service which was made as a homework to show my coding skills.
The task completed according to the task.txt which you may find in this repo as well. 
 
## Build and run 

### Docker and docker-compose

You can run the service in containers. 

#### Prerequisites

-git \
-Docker \
-docker-compose 

#### Installation

Clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:erdees/LoanAmountApprovalService.git
```

cd to a target directory, where service code was cloned: 

````
cd LoanAmountApprovalService
````

And run container:

```
docker-compose up -d
``` 

Build will be done automatically, once container will up and running, service will be ready. 
By default, an application listening port 8080, so it should be available on `http://localhost:8080`
 
### Build and start without containers

#### Prerequisites

-java-1.8.0-openjdk or oracle Java 8 installed (both tested); \
-Graddle 7.3+ installed or use graddle wrapper included in distro \
-git installed; (yum install git on CentOS 7-8)

#### Installation 

Further installation process described for a Linux/Mac machine. For other types of OS it may be different. 

Clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:erdees/LoanAmountApprovalService.git
```

cd to a target directory, where service code was cloned: 

````
cd LoanAmountApprovalService
````

Initiate application build:

````
graddle build
````

Once it finished, the java artifact will be located at build/libs folder named `approvalservice-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

If you want tu run it, type a command at the same folder: 

````
java -jar approvalservice-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
````

Once done, application is up and running.

##### Setting up as a linux Systemd service (rhel example)

If you want to automate application startup, you may use a .service file 
from distro. 

To do it, we need to create systemd .service file which you can copy and configure from root repository folder:

`cp Approval.service /etc/systemd/system/`

Edit required parameters in the .service file.

`vim  /etc/systemd/system/Approval.service`

Change the app working directory where .jar file located, for example: 

`WorkingDirectory=/opt/apps/ApprovalService`

Once done, check java parameters with required quantity of RAM for working application. 

`ExecStart=/bin/java -Xms128m -Xmx128m -jar approvalservice-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

If you have changed anything in .service file, please reload a configuration by using following command:

`systemctl daemon-reload`

To add the app to autostart, use the command:

`systemctl enable Approval.service`

and finally, to start the app:

`systemctl start Approval.service`

By default, an application listening port 8080, so it should be available on `http://localhost:8080`
Now the app up and running, you are beautiful.

## Application description 

ApprovalService is a RESTful service that allows loan preparators to send loan contracts to loan managers for approval. 
Loan preparator must specify the customerâ€™s ID and the amount that customer wants to loan. 
Loan preparator must also specify which managers need to approve it . After the specified managers have added 
their approvals the contract will be automatically sent to the customer.

### Endpoint description

According to original task, an application has three endpoinds:
1) /api/loan/request (POST) \
Where loan preparators should create a request for loan approval. 
The request should have the following format:

````
{
  "customerId": "21-Q2A1-XX9",
  "loanAmount": 1000,
  "approvers": ["Mamertas Juronis", "Gaile Minderyte", "Nina Nugariene"]
}
````

Where:

customerId (String) should be in XX-XXXX-XXX pattern, where X is either number or a letter; \
loanAmount (numeric) should be a number; \
approvers (array of strings) should be a list of loan managers who will approve or decline the request. 
Max. 3 persons allowed. 

When a loan preparator will send a correct request (basic checks on a request format will take a place), the system 
will put the request to a queue where it can be processed by a loan manager.
While the customer with ID has a pending loan, new requests can't be performed. To send a new request, 
a current one should be approved or declined.  

2) /api/loan/approval (POST) \
Where a loan manager should take a decision on a loan. 
The request should have the following format:

````
{
  "customerId": "21-Q2A1-XX9",
  "loanApprover": "Mamertas Juronis",
  "approved": true
}
````

Where:

customerId (string) should be an ID of a customer with a pending loan. \
loanApprover (string) should be one of three or fewer approvers specified during initial request. \
approved (boolean) decision on a loan. If `false` chosen, the contract will not be sent to the customer and will not 
appear in a report. All `true` or approved loans considered to be sent to the customer and appear in statistics. 

3) /api/loan/report (GET) \
Report which shows statistics on approved loans during configured period (can be change in a configuration file). 
Endpoint don't have any parameters or request body.
